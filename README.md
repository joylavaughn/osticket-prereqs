To install osTicket, your web server must have PHP 8.x and MySQL 5.0 (or better) installed. osTicket comes with its own web-based installer to help guide you through the installation process without the frustration. While the installer provides step by step guide during the installation process, itâ€™s important and helpful to have general knowledge about Web servers, PHP and MySQL.
